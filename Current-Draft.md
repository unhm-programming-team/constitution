These facets of an individual will not be considered when voting or appointing them to an officer role, as a member of a committee, as a group project leader, or any other position. Discussions about these things also generally do not belong on the discord or in meetings, as they do not relate to programming.

Any member who sexually harasses any individual on a club communication platform or any individual they met on a club communication platform will be expelled from the club and be reported to the university or the authorities. This club will be a place where all sexes can be comfortable and be treated equally, without having to worry about harassment. This means there is to be no discussion of sex in the discord or in meetings.

1. Vulgar language is not permitted in the Discord or in meetings. While sometimes individuals accidentally swear, consistent violators may face censure, muting, or, in egregious cases, expulsion.

1. Members will treat each other with respect and kindness. Members will show patience with members who do not have as much programming experience as they do. Members will not mock or bully other members.
